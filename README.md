# UPenn-Week-11-Homework-ExpressNoteTaker

## Purpose
To create notes for yourself as a way to organize a to-do list


## Usage
Run the file server.js in NodeJS. Go to your localhost:3000 in any browser. Type a note title and note text and the save icon will appear. Save it and the note will render on the left side of the screen. You can click on the note in that list and see the contents appear on the right side of the screen. From there you can create a new note by clicking the pencil icon in the top right of the screen. 

## Known Issues 
- The delete button does not work. That functionality will be added in a future release of the app.
- The app is deployed on Heroku at https://upennnotetaker.herokuapp.com/ but is currently down for maintenance as of 2/13/2020.
